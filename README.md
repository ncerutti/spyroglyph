# Some photo effects

I saw Chris Holmes' repo (https://github.com/cj-holmes/photos-on-spirals) of cool effects on pictures and I thought I would try and make a python version of it.
Then I thought it would be practical to make a webapp for it.

You can see the webapp here: https://ncerutti-spyroglyph-welcome-bpdyzh.streamlit.app/

I just started, so if anybody wants to collaborate I would be extremely happy, feel free to do so, hit me up and/or open a pull request!

There's plenty to do: the implementation is probably not the quickest, nor the most elegant. Not all options for the double spiral are added. The output could be nicer (the default could be changed), and some more personalisation wouldn't hurt.

Also, I definitely want to add some more nice effects. An easy start perhaps would be to just make it out of vertical or horizontal lines.
