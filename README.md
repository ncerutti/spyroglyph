# Some photo effects

I saw Chris Holmes' repo (https://github.com/cj-holmes/photos-on-spirals) of cool effects on pictures and I thought I would try and make a python version of it.
Then I thought it would be cool to make a webapp for it.

I just started, but if anybody wants to collaborate, feel free to do so and open a pull request!
Also, plenty of issues to be solved yet (not all options for the double spiral work, for example), the output is not the same and some more personalisation wouldn't hurt.
